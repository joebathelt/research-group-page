We are excited to launch our new website

<!--more-->

Life is quite busy with running a research programme, delivering lectures, and setting up new data collection. That leaves precious little time for other important tasks, including designing a website for our group and creating good content for that webpage. After some research, we came across the academic templates from [wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com) that are not only tailored for that purpose but also open-source. This website was created with their templates and bit of tinkering. We think it looks pretty neat!
