 abstract = {Fluid intelligence is the capacity to solve novel problems in the
absence of task-specific knowledge and is highly predictive of
outcomes like educational attainment and psychopathology. Here,
we modeled the neurocognitive architecture of fluid intelligence
in two cohorts: the Centre for Attention, Leaning and Memory
sample (CALM) (N = 551, aged 5-17 years) and the Enhanced Nathan
Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) (N = 335, aged 6-17
years). We used multivariate structural equation modeling to test
a preregistered watershed model of fluid intelligence. This model
predicts that white matter contributes to intermediate cognitive
phenotypes, like working memory and processing speed, which, in
turn, contribute to fluid intelligence. We found that this model
performed well for both samples and explained large amounts of
variance in fluid intelligence (R2CALM = 51.2%, R2NKI-RS =
78.3%). The relationship between cognitive abilities and white
matter differed with age, showing a dip in strength around ages
7-12 years. This age effect may reflect a reorganization of the
neurocognitive architecture around pre- and early puberty.
Overall, these findings highlight that intelligence is part of a
complex hierarchical system of partially independent effects.},
