 abstract = {There is increasing interest in applying connectivity analysis to
brain measures (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010), but most studies have
relied on fMRI, which substantially limits the participant groups
and numbers that can be studied. High-density EEG recordings
offer a comparatively inexpensive easy-to-use alternative, but
require channel-level connectivity analysis which currently lacks
a common analytic framework and is very limited in spatial
resolution. To address this problem, we have developed a new
technique for studies of network development that overcomes the
spatial constraint and obtains functional networks of cortical
areas by using EEG source reconstruction with age-matched average
MRI templates (He et al., 1999). In contrast to previously
reported channel-level analysis, this approach provides
information about the cortical areas most likely to be involved
in the network as well as their functional relationship (Babiloni
et al., 2005; De Vico Fallani et al., 2007). In this study, we
applied source reconstruction with age-matched templates to
task-free high-density EEG recordings in typically-developing
children between 2 and 6 years of age (O'Reilly, 2012). Graph
theory was then applied to the association strengths of 68
cortical regions of interest based on the Desikan-Killiany atlas.
We found linear increases of mean node degree, mean clustering
coefficient and maximum betweenness centrality between 2 years
and 6 years of age. Characteristic path length was negatively
correlated with age. The correlation of the network measures with
age indicates network development towards more closely integrated
networks similar to reports from other imaging modalities (Fair
et al., 2008; Power et al., 2010). We also applied eigenvalue
decomposition to obtain functional modules (Clayden et al.,
2013). Connection strength within these modules did not change
with age, and the modules resembled hub networks previously
described for MRI (Hagmann et al., 2010; Power et al., 2010). The
high temporal resolution of EEG additionally allowed us to
distinguish between frequency bands potentially reflecting
dynamic coupling between different neural oscillators. Generally,
network parameters were similar for networks based on different
frequency bands, but frequency band did emerge as a significant
factor for clustering coefficient and characteristic path length.
In conclusion, the current analysis shows that source
reconstruction of high-density EEG recordings with appropriate
head models offers a valuable tool for estimating network
parameters in studies of brain development. The findings
replicate the pattern of closer functional integration over
development described for other imaging modalities (Fair et al.,
2008; Power et al., 2010).},
