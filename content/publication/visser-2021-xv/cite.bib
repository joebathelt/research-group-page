  abstract = "Most of our knowledge about human emotional memory comes from
              animal research. Based on this work, the amygdala is often
              labeled the brain's ``fear center'', but it is unclear to what
              degree neural circuitries underlying fear and extinction learning
              are conserved across species. Neuroimaging studies in humans
              yield conflicting findings, with many studies failing to show
              amygdala activation in response to learned threat. Such null
              findings are often treated as resulting from MRI-specific
              problems related to measuring deep brain structures. Here we test
              this assumption in a mega-analysis of three studies on fear
              acquisition (n = 98; 68 female) and extinction learning (n = 79;
              53 female). The conditioning procedure involved the presentation
              of two pictures of faces and two pictures of houses: one of each
              pair was followed by an electric shock [a conditioned stimulus
              (CS+)], the other one was never followed by a shock (CS-), and
              participants were instructed to learn these contingencies.
              Results revealed widespread responses to the CS+ compared with
              the CS- in the fear network, including anterior insula,
              midcingulate cortex, thalamus, and bed nucleus of the stria
              terminalis, but not the amygdala, which actually responded
              stronger to the CS- Results were independent of spatial
              smoothing, and of individual differences in trait anxiety and
              conditioned pupil responses. In contrast, robust amygdala
              activation distinguished faces from houses, refuting the idea
              that a poor signal could account for the absence of effects.
              Moving forward, we suggest that, apart from imaging larger
              samples at higher resolution, alternative statistical approaches
              may be used to identify cross-species similarities in fear and
              extinction learning.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The science of
              emotional memory provides the foundation of numerous theories on
              psychopathology, including stress and anxiety disorders. This
              field relies heavily on animal research, which suggests a central
              role of the amygdala in fear learning and memory. However, this
              finding is not strongly corroborated by neuroimaging evidence in
              humans, and null findings are too easily explained away by
              methodological limitations inherent to imaging deep brain
              structures. In a large nonclinical sample, we find widespread
              BOLD activation in response to learned fear, but not in the
              amygdala. A poor signal could not account for the absence of
              effects. While these findings do not disprove the involvement of
              the amygdala in human fear learning, they challenge its typical
              portrayals and illustrate the complexities of translational
              science.",
