  abstract = "We utilized a community detection approach to longitudinally (a)
              identify distinct groups of children with common temperament
              profiles in infancy and at 2 and 3 years of age and (b) determine
              whether co-occurrence of certain temperament traits may be early
              predictors of internalizing problems at 5 years of age. Seven
              hundred and seventy-four infants (360 girls; 88.6\% White, 9.8\%
              Hispanic, and 1.6\% other races) were recruited from the Boston
              area. Data collection spanned from 2012 to 2021. The analysis
              yielded three distinct groups of children with different
              temperament traits and was associated with significant variation
              in levels of internalizing symptoms and anxiety diagnosis rate.
              Our findings suggest that stable temperament ``communities'' can
              be detected in early childhood and may predict risk for
              psychopathology later in life.",
