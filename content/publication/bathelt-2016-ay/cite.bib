 abstract = {Childhood speech and language deficits are highly prevalent and
are a common feature of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, it
is difficult to investigate the underlying causal pathways
because many diagnostic groups have a heterogeneous aetiology.
Studying disorders with a shared genetic cause and shared
cognitive deficits can provide crucial insight into the cellular
mechanisms and neural systems that give rise to those
impairments. The current study investigated structural brain
differences of individuals with mutations in ZDHHC9, which is
associated with a specific neurodevelopmental phenotype including
prominent speech and language impairments and intellectual
disability. We used multiple structural neuroimaging methods to
characterise neuroanatomy in this group, and observed bilateral
reductions in cortical thickness in areas surrounding the
temporo-parietal junction, parietal lobule, and inferior frontal
lobe, and decreased microstructural integrity of cortical,
subcortical-cortical, and interhemispheric white matter
projections. These findings are compared to reports for other
genetic groups and genetically heterogeneous disorders with a
similar presentation. Overlap in the neuroanatomical phenotype
suggests a common pathway that particularly affects the
development of temporo-parietal and inferior frontal areas, and
their connections.},
