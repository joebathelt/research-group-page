 abstract = {Childhood learning difficulties and developmental disorders are
common, but progress toward understanding their underlying brain
mechanisms has been slow. Structural neuroimaging, cognitive, and
learning data were collected from 479 children (299 boys, ranging
in age from 62 to 223 months), 337 of whom had been referred to
the study on the basis of learning-related cognitive problems.
Machine learning identified different cognitive profiles within
the sample, and hold-out cross-validation showed that these
profiles were significantly associated with children's learning
ability. The same machine learning approach was applied to
cortical morphology data to identify different brain profiles.
Hold-out cross-validation demonstrated that these were
significantly associated with children's cognitive profiles.
Crucially, these mappings were not one-to-one. The same neural
profile could be associated with different cognitive impairments
across different children. One possibility is that the
organization of some children's brains is less susceptible to
local deficits. This was tested by using diffusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) to construct whole-brain white-matter connectomes.
A simulated attack on each child's connectome revealed that some
brain networks were strongly organized around highly connected
hubs. Children with these networks had only selective cognitive
impairments or no cognitive impairments at all. By contrast, the
same attacks had a significantly different impact on some
children's networks, because their brain efficiency was less
critically dependent on hubs. These children had the most
widespread and severe cognitive impairments. On this basis, we
propose a new framework in which the nature and mechanisms of
brain-to-cognition relationships are moderated by the
organizational context of the overall network.},
