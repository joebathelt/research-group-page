 abstract = {We used two simple unsupervised machine learning techniques to
identify differential trajectories of change in children who
undergo intensive working memory (WM) training. We used
self-organizing maps (SOMs)-a type of simple artificial neural
network-to represent multivariate cognitive training data, and
then tested whether the way tasks are represented changed as a
result of training. The patterns of change we observed in the SOM
weight matrices implied that the processes drawn upon to perform
WM tasks changed following training. This was then combined with
K-means clustering to identify distinct groups of children who
respond to the training in different ways. Firstly, the K-means
clustering was applied to an independent large sample (N = 616,
Mage = 9.16 years, range = 5.16-17.91 years) to identify
subgroups. We then allocated children who had been through
cognitive training (N = 179, Mage = 9.00 years, range =
7.08-11.50 years) to these same four subgroups, both before and
after their training. In doing so, we were able to map their
improvement trajectories. Scores on a separate measure of fluid
intelligence were predictive of a child's improvement trajectory.
This paper provides an alternative approach to analysing
cognitive training data that go beyond considering changes in
individual tasks. This proof-of-principle demonstrates a
potentially powerful way of distinguishing task-specific from
domain-general changes following training and of establishing
different profiles of response to training.},
