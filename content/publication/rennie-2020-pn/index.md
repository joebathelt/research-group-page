abstract: We used two simple unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify
  differential trajectories of change in children who undergo intensive working memory
  (WM) training. We used self-organizing maps (SOMs)-a type of simple artificial neural
  network-to represent multivariate cognitive training data, and then tested whether
  the way tasks are represented changed as a result of training. The patterns of change
  we observed in the SOM weight matrices implied that the processes drawn upon to
  perform WM tasks changed following training. This was then combined with K-means
  clustering to identify distinct groups of children who respond to the training in
  different ways. Firstly, the K-means clustering was applied to an independent large
  sample (N = 616, Mage = 9.16 years, range = 5.16-17.91 years) to identify subgroups.
  We then allocated children who had been through cognitive training (N = 179, Mage
  = 9.00 years, range = 7.08-11.50 years) to these same four subgroups, both before
  and after their training. In doing so, we were able to map their improvement trajectories. Scores on a separate measure of fluid intelligence were predictive of a child's improvement trajectory. This paper provides an alternative approach to analysing cognitive training data that go beyond considering changes in individual tasks. This proof-of-principle demonstrates a potentially powerful way of distinguishing task-specific from domain-general changes following training and of establishing different profiles of response to training.
