 abstract = {The canonical approach to exploring brain-behaviour relationships
is to group individuals according to a phenotype of interest, and
then explore the neural correlates of this grouping. A limitation
of this approach is that multiple aetiological pathways could
result in a similar phenotype, so the role of any one brain
mechanism may be substantially underestimated. Building on
advances in network analysis, we used a data-driven
community-clustering algorithm to identify robust subgroups based
on white-matter microstructure in childhood and adolescence
(total N = 313, mean age: 11.24 years). The algorithm indicated
the presence of two equal-size groups that show a critical
difference in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the left and right
cingulum. Applying the brain-based grouping in independent
samples, we find that these different 'brain types' had
profoundly different cognitive abilities with higher performance
in the higher FA group. Further, a connectomics analysis
indicated reduced structural connectivity in the low FA subgroup
that was strongly related to reduced functional activation of the
default mode network. These results provide a proof-of-concept
that bottom-up brain-based groupings can be identified that
relate to cognitive performance. This provides a first
demonstration of a complimentary approach for investigating
individual differences in brain structure and function,
particularly for neurodevelopmental disorders where researchers
are often faced with phenotypes that are difficult to define at
the cognitive or behavioural level.},
