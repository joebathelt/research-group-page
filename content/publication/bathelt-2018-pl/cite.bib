 abstract = {The role of vision and vision deprivation in the development of
executive function (EF) abilities in childhood is little
understood; aspects of EF such as initiative, attention
orienting, inhibition, planning and performance monitoring are
often measured through visual tasks. Studying the development and
integrity of EF abilities in children with congenital visual
impairment (VI) may provide important insights into the
development of EF and also its possible relationship with vision
and non-visual senses. The current study investigates non-visual
EF abilities in 18 school-age children of average verbal
intelligence with VI of differing levels of severity arising from
congenital disorders affecting the eye, retina, or anterior optic
nerve. Standard auditory neuropsychological assessments of
sustained and divided attention, phonemic, semantic and switching
verbal fluency, verbal working memory, and ratings of everyday
executive abilities by parents were undertaken. Executive skills
were compared to age-matched typically-sighted (TS)
typically-developing children and across levels of vision (mild
to moderate VI [MVI] or severe to profound VI [SPVI]). The
results do not indicate significant differences or deficits on
direct assessments of verbal and auditory EF between the groups.
However, parent ratings suggest difficulties with everyday
executive abilities, with the greatest difficulties in those with
SPVI. The findings are discussed as possibly reflecting increased
demands of behavioral executive skills for children with VI in
everyday situations despite auditory and verbal EF abilities in
the typical range for their age. These findings have potential
implications for clinical and educational practices.},
