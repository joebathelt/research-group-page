 abstract = {Background: The majority of research effort into autism has been
dedicated to understanding mechanisms during early development.
As a consequence, research on the broader life course of an
autism spectrum condition (ASC) has largely been neglected and
almost nothing is known about ASC beyond middle age. Differences
in brain connectivity that arise during early development may be
maintained across the lifespan and may play protective or
detrimental roles in older age. Method: This study explored
age-related differences in functional connectivity across middle
and older age in clinically diagnosed autistic adults (n = 44,
30-73 years) and in an age-matched typical comparison group (n =
45). Results: The results indicated parallel age-related
associations in ASC and typical aging for the local efficiency
and connection strength of the default mode network and for the
segregation of the frontoparietal control network. In contrast,
group differences in visual network connectivity are compatible
with a safeguarding interpretation of less age-related decline in
brain function in ASC. This divergence was mirrored in different
associations between visual network connectivity and reaction
time variability in the ASC and comparison group. Limitations:
The study is cross-sectional and may be affected by cohort
effects. As all participants received their autism diagnosis in
adulthood, this might hinder generalizability. Conclusion: These
results highlight the complexity of aging in ASC with both
parallel and divergent trajectories across different aspects of
functional network organization.},
