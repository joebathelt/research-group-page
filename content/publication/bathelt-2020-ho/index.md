abstract: 'Background: The majority of research effort into autism has been dedicated
  to understanding mechanisms during early development. As a consequence, research
  on the broader life course of an autism spectrum condition (ASC) has largely been
  neglected and almost nothing is known about ASC beyond middle age. Differences in
  brain connectivity that arise during early development may be maintained across
  the lifespan and may play protective or detrimental roles in older age. Method:
  This study explored age-related differences in functional connectivity across middle
  and older age in clinically diagnosed autistic adults (n = 44, 30-73 years) and
  in an age-matched typical comparison group (n = 45). Results: The results indicated
  parallel age-related associations in ASC and typical aging for the local efficiency
  and connection strength of the default mode network and for the segregation of the
  frontoparietal control network. In contrast, group differences in visual network
  connectivity are compatible with a safeguarding interpretation of less age-related
  decline in brain function in ASC. This divergence was mirrored in different associations between visual network connectivity and reaction time variability in the ASC and comparison group. Limitations: The study is cross-sectional and may be affected by cohort effects. As all participants received their autism diagnosis in adulthood, this might hinder generalizability. Conclusion: These results highlight the complexity of aging in ASC with both parallel and divergent trajectories across different aspects of functional network organization.'
