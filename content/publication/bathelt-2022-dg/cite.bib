  abstract  = "Abstract Network approaches that investigate the interaction
               between symptoms and behaviours have opened new ways of
               understanding psychological phenomena in health and disorder in
               recent years. In a parallel, network approaches that
               characterise the interaction between brain regions have become
               the dominant approach in neuroimaging research. In this paper,
               we introduce a methodology for combining network psychometrics
               and network neuroscience. This approach utilises the information
               from the psychometric network to obtain neural correlates that
               are associated with each node in the psychometric network
               (network-based regression). Moreover, we combine the behavioural
               variables and their neural correlates in a joint network to
               characterise their interactions. We illustrate the approach by
               highlighting the interaction between the triad of autistic
               traits and their resting-state functional connectivity
               associations. To this end, we utilise data from 172 male
               autistic participants (10--21 years) from the autism brain data
               exchange (ABIDE, ABIDE-II) that completed resting-state fMRI and
               were assessed using the autism diagnostic interview (ADI-R). Our
               results indicate that the network-based regression approach can
               uncover both unique and shared neural correlates of behavioural
               measures. For instance, our example analysis indicates that the
               overlap between communication and social difficulties is not
               reflected in the overlap between their functional brain
               correlates.",
