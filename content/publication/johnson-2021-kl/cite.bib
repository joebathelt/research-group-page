 abstract = {Previous studies have identified localized associations between
childhood environment - namely their socio-economic status (SES)
- and particular neural structures. The primary aim of the
current study was to test whether associations between SES and
brain structure are widespread or limited to specific neural
pathways. We employed advances in whole-brain structural
connectomics to address this. Diffusion tensor imaging was used
to construct whole-brain connectomes in 113 6-12 year olds. We
then applied an adapted multi-block partial-least squares (PLS)
regression to explore how connectome organisation is associated
with childhood SES (parental income, education levels, and
neighbourhood deprivation). The Fractional Anisotropy (FA)
connectome was significantly associated with childhood SES and
this effect was widespread. We then pursued a secondary aim, and
demonstrated that the connectome mediated the relationship
between SES and cognitive ability (matrix reasoning and
vocabulary). However, the connectome did not significantly
mediate SES relationships with academic ability (maths and
reading) or internalising and externalising behavior. This
multivariate approach is important for advancing our theoretical
understanding of how brain development may be shaped by childhood
environment, and the role that it plays in predicting key
outcomes. We also discuss the limitations with this new
methodological approach.},
