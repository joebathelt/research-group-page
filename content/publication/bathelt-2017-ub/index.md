abstract: Knowledge of genetic cause in neurodevelopmental disorders can highlight
  molecular and cellular processes critical for typical development. Furthermore,
  the relative homogeneity of neurodevelopmental disorders of known genetic origin
  allows the researcher to establish the subsequent neurobiological processes that
  mediate cognitive and behavioral outcomes. The current study investigated white
  matter structural connectivity in a group of individuals with intellectual disability
  due to mutations in ZDHHC9. In addition to shared cause of cognitive impairment,
  these individuals have a shared cognitive profile, involving oromotor control difficulties
  and expressive language impairment. Analysis of structural network properties using
  graph theory measures showed global reductions in mean clustering coefficient and
  efficiency in the ZDHHC9 group, with maximal differences in frontal and parietal
  areas. Regional variation in clustering coefficient across cortical regions in ZDHHC9
  mutation cases was significantly associated with known pattern of expression of
  ZDHHC9 in the normal adult human brain. The results demonstrate that a mutation
  in a single gene impacts upon white matter organization across the whole-brain,
  but also shows regionally specific effects, according to variation in gene expression.
  Furthermore, these regionally specific patterns may link to specific developmental
  mechanisms, and correspond to specific cognitive deficits.
