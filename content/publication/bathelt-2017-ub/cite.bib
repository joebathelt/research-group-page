 abstract = {Knowledge of genetic cause in neurodevelopmental disorders can
highlight molecular and cellular processes critical for typical
development. Furthermore, the relative homogeneity of
neurodevelopmental disorders of known genetic origin allows the
researcher to establish the subsequent neurobiological processes
that mediate cognitive and behavioral outcomes. The current study
investigated white matter structural connectivity in a group of
individuals with intellectual disability due to mutations in
ZDHHC9. In addition to shared cause of cognitive impairment,
these individuals have a shared cognitive profile, involving
oromotor control difficulties and expressive language impairment.
Analysis of structural network properties using graph theory
measures showed global reductions in mean clustering coefficient
and efficiency in the ZDHHC9 group, with maximal differences in
frontal and parietal areas. Regional variation in clustering
coefficient across cortical regions in ZDHHC9 mutation cases was
significantly associated with known pattern of expression of
ZDHHC9 in the normal adult human brain. The results demonstrate
that a mutation in a single gene impacts upon white matter
organization across the whole-brain, but also shows regionally
specific effects, according to variation in gene expression.
Furthermore, these regionally specific patterns may link to
specific developmental mechanisms, and correspond to specific
cognitive deficits.},
