  abstract = "LAY ABSTRACT: Some theories suggested that social difficulties in
              autism arise from differences in the processing of faces. If
              face-processing difficulties are central to autism, then they
              should be as persistent as social difficulties across the
              lifespan. We tested this by asking autistic and neurotypical
              participants between 30 and 75 years to complete face detection
              tasks. Both autistic and neurotypical adults responded more
              slowly with age. When participants had to respond quickly,
              autistic adults made more errors in face detection regardless of
              their age. However, when the time constraint was removed,
              autistic adults performed as well as the neurotypical group.
              Across tasks, autistic adults responded more slowly when asked to
              detect both face and non-face stimuli. We also investigated brain
              activation differences in the face detection task with functional
              magnetic resonance imaging. The results indicated lower
              activation in the autism group in the left and right superior
              frontal gyrus. The superior frontal gyrus is not typically
              implicated in face processing but in more general processing, for
              example, keeping instructions in mind and following them.
              Together with the behavioral results, this suggests that there is
              no specific deficit in face processing in autistic adults between
              30 and 75 years. Instead, the results suggest differences in
              general processing, particularly in the speed of processing.
              However, this needs to be investigated further with methods that
              are more sensitive to the timing of brain activation.",
