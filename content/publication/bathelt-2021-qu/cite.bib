  abstract = "PURPOSE: Young people change substantially between childhood and
              adolescence. Yet, the current description of behavioural problems
              does not incorporate any reference to the developmental context.
              In the current analysis, we aimed to identify common transitions
              of behavioural problems between childhood and adolescence.
              METHOD: We followed 6744 individuals over 6 years as they
              transitioned from childhood (age 10) into adolescence (age 16).
              At each stage, we used a data-driven hierarchical clustering
              method to identify common profiles of behavioural problems, map
              transitions between profiles and identify factors that predict
              specific transitions. RESULTS: Common profiles of behavioural
              problems matched known comorbidity patterns but crucially showed
              that the presentation of behavioural problems changes markedly
              between childhood and adolescence. While problems with
              hyperactivity/impulsivity, motor control and conduct were
              prominent in childhood, adolescents showed profiles of problems
              related to emotional control, anxiety and inattention.
              Transitions were associated with socio-economic status and
              cognitive performance in childhood CONCLUSION: We show that
              understanding behavioural difficulties and mental ill-health must
              take into account the developmental context in which the problems
              occur, and we establish key risk factors for specific negative
              transitions as children become adolescents.",
