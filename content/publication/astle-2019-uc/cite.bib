 abstract = {Our understanding of learning difficulties largely comes from
children with specific diagnoses or individuals selected from
community/clinical samples according to strict inclusion
criteria. Applying strict exclusionary criteria overemphasizes
within group homogeneity and between group differences, and fails
to capture comorbidity. Here, we identify cognitive profiles in a
large heterogeneous sample of struggling learners, using
unsupervised machine learning in the form of an artificial neural
network. Children were referred to the Centre for Attention
Learning and Memory (CALM) by health and education professionals,
irrespective of diagnosis or comorbidity, for problems in
attention, memory, language, or poor school progress (n = 530).
Children completed a battery of cognitive and learning
assessments, underwent a structural MRI scan, and their parents
completed behavior questionnaires. Within the network we could
identify four groups of children: (a) children with broad
cognitive difficulties, and severe reading, spelling and maths
problems; (b) children with age-typical cognitive abilities and
learning profiles; (c) children with working memory problems; and
(d) children with phonological difficulties. Despite their
contrasting cognitive profiles, the learning profiles for the
latter two groups did not differ: both were around 1 SD below
age-expected levels on all learning measures. Importantly a
child's cognitive profile was not predicted by diagnosis or
referral reason. We also constructed whole-brain structural
connectomes for children from these four groupings (n = 184),
alongside an additional group of typically developing children (n
= 36), and identified distinct patterns of brain organization for
each group. This study represents a novel move toward identifying
data-driven neurocognitive dimensions underlying learning-related
difficulties in a representative sample of poor learners.},
