 abstract = {Working memory (WM) skills are closely associated with learning
progress in key areas such as reading and mathematics across
childhood. As yet, however, little is known about how the brain
systems underpinning WM develop over this critical developmental
period. The current study investigated whether and how structural
brain correlates of components of the working memory system
change over development. Verbal and visuospatial short-term and
working memory were assessed in 153 children between 5.58 and
15.92 years, and latent components of the working memory system
were derived. Fractional anisotropy and cortical thickness maps
were derived from T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI and
processed using eigenanatomy decomposition. There was a greater
involvement of the corpus callosum and posterior temporal white
matter in younger children for performance associated with the
executive part of the working memory system. For older children,
this was more closely linked with the thickness of the
occipitotemporal cortex. These findings suggest that increasing
specialization leads to shifts in the contribution of neural
substrates over childhood, moving from an early dependence on a
distributed system supported by long-range connections to later
reliance on specialized local circuitry. Our findings demonstrate
that despite the component factor structure being stable across
childhood, the underlying brain systems supporting working memory
change. Taking the age of the child into account, and not just
their overall score, is likely to be critical for understanding
the nature of the limitations on their working memory capacity.},
