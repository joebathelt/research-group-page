 abstract = {Literacy and numeracy are important skills that are typically
learned during childhood, a time that coincides with considerable
shifts in large-scale brain organization. However, most studies
emphasize focal brain contributions to literacy and numeracy
development by employing case-control designs and voxel-by-voxel
statistical comparisons. This approach has been valuable, but may
underestimate the contribution of overall brain network
organization. The current study includes children (N = 133
children; 86 male; mean age = 9.42, SD = 1.715; age range =
5.92-13.75y) with a broad range of abilities, and uses
whole-brain structural connectomics based on diffusion-weighted
MRI data. The results indicate that academic attainment is
associated with differences in structural brain organization,
something not seen when focusing on the integrity of specific
regions. Furthermore, simulated disruption of highly-connected
brain regions known as hubs suggests that the role of these
regions for maintaining the architecture of the network may be
more important than specific aspects of processing. Our findings
indicate that distributed brain systems contribute to the
etiology of difficulties with academic learning, which cannot be
captured using a more traditional voxel-wise statistical
approach.},
