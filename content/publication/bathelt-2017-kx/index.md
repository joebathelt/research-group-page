abstract: Communication with visual signals, like facial expression, is important
  in early social development, but the question if these signals are necessary for
  typical social development remains to be addressed. The potential impact on social
  development of being born with no or very low levels of vision is therefore of high
  theoretical and clinical interest. The current study investigated event-related
  potential responses to basic social stimuli in a rare group of school-aged children
  with congenital visual disorders of the anterior visual system (globe of the eye,
  retina, anterior optic nerve). Early-latency event-related potential responses showed
  no difference between the VI and control group, suggesting similar initial auditory
  processing. However, the mean amplitude over central and right frontal channels
  between 280 and 320ms was reduced in response to own-name stimuli, but not control
  stimuli, in children with VI suggesting differences in social processing. Children
  with VI also showed an increased rate of autistic-related behaviours, pragmatic language deficits, as well as peer relationship and emotional problems on standard
  parent questionnaires. These findings suggest that vision may be necessary for the
  typical development of social processing across modalities.
