  abstract = "In recent years, there has been an increase in applications of
              network science in many different fields. In clinical
              neuroscience and psychopathology, the developments and
              applications of network science have occurred mostly
              simultaneously, but without much collaboration between the two
              fields. The promise of integrating these network applications
              lies in a united framework to tackle one of the fundamental
              questions of our time: how to understand the link between brain
              and behavior. In the current overview, we bridge this gap by
              introducing conventions in both fields, highlighting
              similarities, and creating a common language that enables the
              exploitation of synergies. We provide research examples in autism
              research, as it accurately represents research lines in both
              network neuroscience and psychological networks. We integrate
              brain and behavior not only semantically, but also practically,
              by showcasing three methodological avenues that allow to combine
              networks of brain and behavioral data. As such, the current paper
              offers a stepping stone to further develop multi-modal networks
              and to integrate brain and behavior.",
