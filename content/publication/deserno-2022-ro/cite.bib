  abstract = "The clinical validity of the distinction between ADHD and ASD is
              a longstanding discussion. Recent advances in the realm of
              data-driven analytic techniques now enable us to formally
              investigate theories aiming to explain the frequent co-occurrence
              of these neurodevelopmental conditions. In this study, we probe
              different theoretical positions by means of a pre-registered
              integrative approach of novel classification, subgrouping, and
              taxometric techniques in a representative sample (N = 434), and
              replicate the results in an independent sample (N = 219) of
              children (ADHD, ASD, and typically developing) aged 7-14 years.
              First, Random Forest Classification could predict diagnostic
              groups based on questionnaire data with limited
              accuracy-suggesting some remaining overlap in behavioral symptoms
              between them. Second, community detection identified four
              distinct groups, but none of them showed a symptom profile
              clearly related to either ADHD or ASD in neither the original
              sample nor the replication sample. Third, taxometric analyses
              showed evidence for a categorical distinction between ASD and
              typically developing children, a dimensional characterization of
              the difference between ADHD and typically developing children,
              and mixed results for the distinction between the diagnostic
              groups. We present a novel framework of cutting-edge statistical
              techniques which represent recent advances in both the models and
              the data used for research in psychiatric nosology. Our results
              suggest that ASD and ADHD cannot be unambiguously characterized
              as either two separate clinical entities or opposite ends of a
              spectrum, and highlight the need to study ADHD and ASD traits in
              tandem.",
