abstract: EEG is traditionally described as a neuroimaging technique with high temporal
  and low spatial resolution. Recent advances in biophysical modelling and signal
  processing make it possible to exploit information from other imaging modalities
  like structural MRI that provide high spatial resolution to overcome this constraint.
  This is especially useful for investigations that require high resolution in the
  temporal as well as spatial domain. In addition, due to the easy application and
  low cost of EEG recordings, EEG is often the method of choice when working with
  populations, such as young children, that do not tolerate functional MRI scans well.
  However, in order to investigate which neural substrates are involved, anatomical
  information from structural MRI is still needed. Most EEG analysis packages work
  with standard head models that are based on adult anatomy. The accuracy of these
  models when used for children is limited, because the composition and spatial configuration of head tissues changes dramatically over development. In the present paper, we provide an overview of our recent work in utilizing head models based on individual structural MRI scans or age specific head models to reconstruct the cortical generators of high density EEG. This article describes how EEG recordings are acquired, processed, and analyzed with pediatric populations at the London Baby Lab, including laboratory setup, task design, EEG preprocessing, MRI processing, and EEG channel level and source analysis.
