 abstract = {EEG is traditionally described as a neuroimaging technique with
high temporal and low spatial resolution. Recent advances in
biophysical modelling and signal processing make it possible to
exploit information from other imaging modalities like structural
MRI that provide high spatial resolution to overcome this
constraint. This is especially useful for investigations that
require high resolution in the temporal as well as spatial
domain. In addition, due to the easy application and low cost of
EEG recordings, EEG is often the method of choice when working
with populations, such as young children, that do not tolerate
functional MRI scans well. However, in order to investigate which
neural substrates are involved, anatomical information from
structural MRI is still needed. Most EEG analysis packages work
with standard head models that are based on adult anatomy. The
accuracy of these models when used for children is limited,
because the composition and spatial configuration of head tissues
changes dramatically over development. In the present paper, we
provide an overview of our recent work in utilizing head models
based on individual structural MRI scans or age specific head
models to reconstruct the cortical generators of high density
EEG. This article describes how EEG recordings are acquired,
processed, and analyzed with pediatric populations at the London
Baby Lab, including laboratory setup, task design, EEG
preprocessing, MRI processing, and EEG channel level and source
analysis.},
