 abstract = {General cognitive ability, sometimes referred to as intelligence,
is associated with educational attainment throughout childhood.
Most studies that have explored the neural correlates of
intelligence in childhood focus on individual brain regions. This
analytical approach is designed to identify restricted sets of
voxels that overlap across participants. By contrast, we explored
the relationship between white matter connectome organization,
intelligence, and education. In both a sample of
typically-developing children (N = 63) and a sample of struggling
learners (N = 139), the white matter connectome efficiency was
strongly associated with intelligence and educational attainment.
Further, intelligence partially mediated the relationship between
connectome efficiency and educational attainment. In contrast, a
canonical voxel-wise analysis failed to identify any significant
relationships. The results emphasize the importance of
distributed brain network properties for cognitive or educational
ability in childhood. Our findings are interpreted in the context
of a developmental theory, which emphasizes the interaction
between different subsystems over developmental time.},
