abstract: BACKGROUND - Adaptive behaviours are vital skills that allow individuals to function independently and are potentially amenable to behavioural interventions. Previous research indicated that adaptive behaviours are reduced in children and adolescents with severe to profound VI, but it was unclear if this was also the case for children with mild to moderate VI. AIM - The aim of the study was to assess differences in adaptive behaviour in children with congenital visual disorders and different levels of visual impairment and their influence on quality of life and everyday strengths and difficulties. METHODS - Questionnaires about adaptive behaviour, strengths and difficulties, and quality of life were completed by parents of school-age children with severe-to-profound VI (S/PVI, n = 9, 0.9 logMAR – light perception only), mild-to-moderate VI (MVI, n = 9, 0.1–0.7 logMAR), or typical sight (control, n = 18, −0.3 to 0.1 logMAR). Differences in questionnaire domains by the severity of VI and relationships between adaptive behaviour and quality of life were analysed in general linear models. RESULTS The questionnaire ratings indicated reduced adaptive behaviour, more difficulties, and reduced quality of life in children with S/PVI compared to typically-sighted peers. Effects were smaller for children with MVI, but indicated a significant reduction in quality of life compared to typically-sighted children. The effect of visual impairment on quality of life in school was partially mediated by adaptive behaviour. CONCLUSION Severe congenital visual impairment affects adaptive behaviour in children with verbal abilities in the typical range. This effect is less pronounced in children with mild-to-moderate VI, but still impacts on quality of life, particularly in school.
