 abstract = {AIM: To examine if congenital visual impairment is associated
with differences in brain anatomy in children. METHOD: Ten
children (8-12y) with congenital disorders of the peripheral
visual system with severe visual impairment (SVI; >0.8 logMAR) or
mild-to-moderate visual impairment (MVI; 0.6-0.8 logMAR) were
compared to 21 typically sighted comparison (TSC) children.
Thalamus volume, grey matter density, white matter
microstructure, and integrity of visual tracts were investigated
in SVI, MVI, and TSC groups with anatomical and
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Compared
to the TSC group, the SVI group had lower white matter integrity
in tracts of the visual system (optic radiations: SVI
0.35$±$0.015, TSC 0.39$±$0.007 [p=0.022]; posterior corpus
callosum: SVI 0.37$±$0.019; TSC 0.42$±$0.009 [p=0.033]) and
lower left thalamus volume (SVI 4.37$±$0.087; TSC
4.99$±$0.339 [p=0.015]). Neuroanatomical differences were
greater in the SVI group, while no consistent differences between
the MVI and TSC group were observed. INTERPRETATION: Posterior
tracts of the visual system are compromised in children with
congenital visual impairment versus those who are typically
sighted. The severity of visual input appears to have affected
neuroanatomical development as significant reductions were only
found in the SVI group. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Severe visual
impairment in mid-childhood is associated with reduced integrity
of visual pathways and reduced thalamus volume.},
